## Description

_Grab what's in your pennybank and see how much money you have in Rupees! or Jamaican Dollars! The choice is entirely yours. This application will accept an amount you give it and tell you what that amount is in a specified currency!_ 

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Head over to exchangerate-api.com and create an free account by entering your email address and pressing "Get Free Key!"
* On the next window, go ahead and verify that you accept their terms and conditions of having a free account. Then choose a password and press "Accept Terms & Create API Key!"
* You'll need to then go to the email address you provided's inbox and find their confirmation email -- go ahead and click the link they sent you.
* The link will redirect you back to the API site and assign you a key -- save this API key somewhere precious, this is your key and your key alone*!  

* Go back to this repository and git clone it to your computer.
* Create a file in this folder's root and name it ".env" and open it in a terminal-friendly code editor.
* Copy and paste your API key into that file after "API_KEY=". In order for the application to work, make sure it follows the exact format in the example.  
  Example: 
> API_KEY=1a2b3c4d5f6g7h
* Install the necessary packages to build the site by typing "npm install" into the terminal.
* Build the project and run it in your default browser by typing "npm start" in the terminal.
*  Enter an amount of currency and currency type, select a currency to convert it to, press 'Convert My Currency!', and ta-da! The converted amount should be returned back to you.

_* If you plan to upload this into your own repository, make sure that your API key (or file its enclosed in) continues to remain hidden by using .gitignore or something equally as secure._
